## Purpose of This Project  
The 2023 Stack Overflow survey contains responses from developers worldwide, comprising approximately 90,000 rows and 80 features. This dataset provides valuable insights into key factors influencing career choices and programming language preferences. Our goal is to explore different clustering techniques and regression models to predict users' income based on selected features. These predictions will consider multiple factors, such as education, country, programming languages, job title, and more.  

## What We Did in Part 1  
In this phase, we began processing the data using Pandas to gain a deeper understanding of the Stack Overflow survey. We performed data cleaning and grouping, then focused on responses from the United States, which includes around 11,000 rows. Additionally, we visualized trends in popular programming languages and explored relationships between age, programming languages, job titles, and income.  

## Project Trajectory  
- Implement clustering techniques to group respondents based on relevant features.  
- Apply regression models to predict income within different clusters.  
- Develop a small user interface that allows users to input certain features and estimate potential earnings based on their goals.  
- Beyond prediction, this project serves as an in-depth exploration of an interesting dataset, making it a valuable data science endeavor.
