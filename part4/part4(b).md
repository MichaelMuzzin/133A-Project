<h3 style="color:#7216e6">(a) Basic Linear Model</h3>

<h4 style="color:#FF5733">What to Check:</h4>
For the basic model (which uses standardized features without any additional transformation), you would typically compute the mean and standard deviation of each coefficient across the 5 folds.
<h4 style="color:#FF5733">Expected Behavior:</h4>
Since the features are standardized and the model is simple, the coefficients should be relatively similar from fold to fold (i.e. low standard deviation relative to their mean).
<h4 style="color:#FF5733">Implication:</h4>
Low variability in the parameters implies that the model is numerically stable. Any large differences, on the other hand, might signal sensitivity to the training set split.

<h3 style="color:#7216e6">(b) Feature Engineering with K-Means Clustering</h3>

<h3 style="color:#7216e6">What to Check:</h3>

In this model, extra "cluster" features are appended as dummy variables. You would examine the coefficients for both the original features and the new cluster dummies across the folds.
<h4 style="color:#FF5733">Expected Behavior:</h4>

Since the clusters are computed once on the entire dataset, you'd expect the corresponding coefficients to be reasonably consistent across folds.
<h4 style="color:#FF5733">Implication:</h4>
Consistency (i.e. small standard deviations) in these coefficients suggests that the augmentation is robust and that the extra features are not introducing numerical instability.

<h3 style="color:#7216e6">(c) Regularized Ridge Model with Expanded Basis Functions</h3>

<h4 style="color:#FF5733">What to Check:</h4>

For this model, instead of reporting per-fold coefficient variability, we focus on the norm of the model parameters.
Reported Value:
The norm of the best Ridge model’s parameters is approximately `3.4383`.
<h4 style="color:#FF5733">Expected Behavior:</h4>

Ridge regression includes a regularization term that penalizes large coefficients. A small norm indicates that the coefficients are "shrunk" towards zero, reducing the risk of overfitting and mitigating issues with multicollinearity.
<h4 style="color:#FF5733">Implication:</h4>
The modest parameter norm is evidence that the Ridge model is numerically stable, with parameters kept in check across the different folds.

<h3 style="color:#7216e6">(d) Non-Linear Model using Degree-3 Polynomial Expansion</h3>

<h4 style="color:#FF5733">What to Check:</h4>

For the non-linear model, you would again examine the mean and standard deviation of each of the (now many more) coefficients across the 5 folds.
<h4 style="color:#FF5733">Expected Behavior:</h4>

A third-order polynomial expansion dramatically increases the number of features (and thus model parameters). This increase often leads to multicollinearity and overfitting, which tend to yield highly variable (and possibly very large in magnitude) coefficients across folds.
<h4 style="color:#FF5733">Observed Outcome:</h4>

The extremely high RMS error (≈ 125,755,957) already suggests that the model's predictions are unstable. In practice, you would likely see very high standard deviations relative to the means of the coefficients—confirming that the model suffers from numerical instability.
<h4 style="color:#FF5733">Implication:</h4>
The degree-3 expansion likely introduces severe overparameterization, which results in significant fluctuations in the estimated parameters across the folds.

<h3 style="color:#7216e6">Summary & Conclusion</h3>
<h4 style="color:#FF5733">Basic Model (3a):</h4>

Expected to have stable coefficients (low variance across folds) due to simplicity and feature standardization.

<h4 style="color:#FF5733">K-Means Enhanced Model (3b):</h4>

The added cluster dummies should yield consistent parameter estimates if the clustering is robust; a moderate degree of variability might be observed, but overall stability is expected.

<h4 style="color:#FF5733">Ridge with 2nd-Order Expansion (3c):</h4>

The small norm (≈ 3.4383) of the coefficients is a strong indication of numerical stability, thanks to the regularization effect that controls parameter magnitude.

<h4 style="color:#FF5733">Degree-3 Polynomial Model (3d):</h4>

This model’s drastically increased number of parameters is likely to show high variability across folds. The extremely poor RMS error further confirms that the model suffers from numerical instability.

<h4 style="color:#FF5733">Conclusion</h4>

Overall, examining the variability of the coefficients across folds (by computing their means and standard deviations) would provide a concrete measure of stability. In this experiment, the regularized model with a `second-order expansion (3c)` strikes the best balance between model complexity and numerical stability.
