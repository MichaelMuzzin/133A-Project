<h3 style="color:#7216e6">Goal of this project:</h3>
<p>We want to be able to achieve a prediction based on stackoverflow 2024 developer survey, which more than 70,000 developers have responded to. 
The goals is to be able to predict the annual income of a future developer based on their experience, education, AI tools used, programming language used, job title.</p>
<p>Stackoverflow 2024 survey was a really good entry to data science and extracting new informations. The data is reach and allows us to investigate interesting in each section of this project. First part is our investigation and cleaning up some data to be able to aggregate and display some informations. We decided to focus only on <b>United States of America</b> where we studied 11,000 responses.</p>
<p>Part 2 included more of data cleaning and allowed us to get from 110 features (columns) to 32 features (columns). We also replaced each string reponse with its correspondent number. We used mapping functions and mapped each answer to a number where we could easily pipe this data to other data aggregation functions to be able to get the standardized data and their correlation graph.</p>
